## Computer Science Student | May 2025 Graduate | Passionate About Technology and Problem-Solving

I am a dedicated Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona, graduating in May 2025, with a passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems. My coursework and projects have provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, as well as experience in web development, data structures, and algorithms.

My academic projects have allowed me to gain hands-on experience in software development, spanning game design, mobile application development, database management, and artificial intelligence. I have led teams to build interactive and scalable applications, integrating real-time communication, dynamic user interfaces, and optimized algorithms. Through these projects, I have honed my programming skills, strengthened my understanding of software architecture, and developed a collaborative approach to problem-solving.
As I approach graduation, I am actively seeking internships or entry-level opportunities for Summer 2025 to contribute to dynamic teams and grow as a professional. Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can work together to achieve technological advancements!
